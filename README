# Ansible Role - links

Configure NAT rules on a EVX updating the following files:

Add this as a role to an Ansible playbook `roles` directory, then configure the playbook to use it:

Example inventory:
```yaml
---
all:
  hosts:
    example:
      # [...]

```

Example playbook:
```yaml
---
- name: 'Example Playbook - natrule'
  hosts: 'all'

  roles:
    - role: 'links'

# or

  tasks:
    - name: 'Include role - natrule'
      include_role:
        name: 'links'
```
